# technical-documentation-page

Fulfilled a Freecodecamp project that is focused on building a proper technical documentation page.

Here, I really implemented HTML, CSS, and responsive web design knowledge through an attentive lens.

I did run into minor issues with making sure the sidebar remains positioned fixed to the left while the page is viewed on larger screens; however, after thorough research, I found my solution and configured the necessary media queries.
